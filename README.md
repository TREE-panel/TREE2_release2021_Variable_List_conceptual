#  Conceptual list of variables, panel waves 0-2 (2016-2018)

Concept and objective of [this document](https://github.com/TREE-panel/TREE2_release2021_Variable_List_conceptual/raw/main/TREE2_Variable_List_conceptual.xlsx)

This document is intended to help data users find their way around at the conceptual-content level. In this file, all variables available in the TREE2 data release are arranged topically. In addition, the survey time and mode as well as the sources are indicated. The topical order follows the theoretical framework of TREE, which is illustrated in the section below.

Theoretical framework and topical order

As an overarching theoretical framework, we draw on the life course paradigm (Baltes, 1990; Blossfeld, von Maurice, Bayer, & Skopek, 2016; Elder, 1994; Schoon & Silbereisen, 2009), which has been systematised by Bernardi et al. (2019) in a three-dimensional matrix accounting for temporal interdependencies as well as interdependencies between different levels resp. life domains (for more detail cf. Hupka-Brunner, Krebs-Oesch, Sacchi, & Meyer, forthcoming). The figure below adapts Bernardi et al.’s life course cube to the specific purposes  of the TREE study.

The graph shows the biographical age as well as the historical time for both cohorts. In addition, the supra-individual level shows which social trends and events we believe may have influenced the trajectories of the two cohorts.

The arrows indicate key transitions or developmental tasks that adolescents and (young) adults typically face at a particular stage of life.

The survey programme of TREE covers the level of individual-action as well as intra-individual processes: Within the individual-action level, the survey programme refers to the life domains of education, employment (and other situations), family & significant others, social-cultural participation, and health & well-being. With regard to intra-individual processes, non-cognitive factors and cognitive skills are taken into account.

All variables are clustered hierarchically. The "Topic list" worksheet contains the three levels of this structure and the more detailed concepts measured by TREE2.

In the life domain "Education - Employment" a distinction is made between the topical level "Educational pathways and transitions" and "Educational situation (general, school & training firm) & post-compulsory pathways": In the "Educational pathways and transitions" block, the focus is primarily on those educationally relevant items that relate either to the compulsory school years ("educational biography", "Educational decisions (transitions from lower to upper secondary education)") or to educational attitudes (objectives, aspirations, plans) that were already surveyed at the end of compulsory schooling and later again in the TREE2 panel. In contrast, the block "Educational situation (general, school & training firm) & post-compulsory pathways" focuses on questions that reflect the current situation in the follow-up surveys as well as the development since the end of compulsory school.

TREE strives to implement concepts that can be analyzed from different theoretical perspectives. In this respect and beyond the attribution between concept and theory made here, there may be other theoretical attributions. This topical classification therefore makes no claim to completeness or unambiguity of attributions.

### Technical features

Only survey variables are listed in the "Topic list" worksheet. Variables that represent technical data (e.g. sampling or mode information, weights) are listed in the "Not in topic list" worksheet.

The topic list contains the different levels of the content structure, the concept, the variable name and the labels. In addition, the sources of the items can be found here, as well as information on when and how they were collected and in which data files they can be found. The variable "sort-id" should help to restore the original sorting if necessary. 

The current activity information is identical and consistent with the episode information. However, in the episode files, the start, end, episode type, and episode number are stored across all episode types (education, employment, other situations). Thus, this episode information is cross-topical and therefore appears only in the "Not in topic list". The current wave-specific activities are then derived from these episodes in a type-specific manner, and can therefore also be assigned topically. They appear in the "Topic list". For a more detailed explanation of the relationship between episodes and wave-specific data, see Hupka-Brunner et al. (2021). 
In addition, there are various technical episode identifiers that facilitate merging wave-specific and episodic data.

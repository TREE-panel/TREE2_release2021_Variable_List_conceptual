#  Conceptual list of variables, panel waves 0-2 (2016-2018)

Concept and objective of this document

This document is intended to help data users find their way around at the conceptual-content level. In this file, all variables available in the TREE2 data release are arranged topically. In addition, the survey time and mode as well as the sources are indicated. The topical order follows the theoretical framework of TREE, which is illustrated in the section below.

Theoretical framework and topical order

As an overarching theoretical framework, we draw on the life course paradigm (Baltes, 1990; Blossfeld, von Maurice, Bayer, & Skopek, 2016; Elder, 1994; Schoon & Silbereisen, 2009), which has been systematised by Bernardi et al. (2019) in a three-dimensional matrix accounting for temporal interdependencies as well as interdependencies between different levels resp. life domains (for more detail cf. Hupka-Brunner, Krebs-Oesch, Sacchi, & Meyer, forthcoming). The figure below adapts Bernardi et al.’s life course cube to the specific purposes  of the TREE study.
